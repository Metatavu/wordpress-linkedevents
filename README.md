### Theming

#### Events list theming

Gutenberg event list has a theming support. 

By default plugin renders very basic event list but you can customize how the list is rendered by adding linkedevents/events.php into you theme.

Theming can be enabled by adding linkedevents -folder into your theme and adding events.php file inside it. 

The events.php file can be used to render the event how ever the theme developer wishes it. All events are exposed in variable $data->events. 

The events list objects are [Event](https://github.com/Metatavu/linkedevents-client-php/blob/master/lib/Model/Event.php) -instances from [linkedevents-client-php](https://github.com/Metatavu/linkedevents-client-php) -library

events.php can contain any php code. Here is a small example that renders event name, time and description inside article tag: 
    
    foreach ($data->events as $event) {
      $result = "";
      $result .= '<article>';
      $result .= '<div>';

      $eventName = $event["name"]["fi"];
      $eventLink = $event["externalLinks"][0]["link"];
      $eventDescription = $event["description"]["fi"];
      $eventTime = $event["startTime"]->format("l jS F Y G:ia");
      $result .= sprintf('<a href="%s">%s</a>', $eventLink, $eventName);
      $result .= sprintf('<p>%s</p>', $eventTime);
      $result .= sprintf('<p>%s</p>', html_entity_decode($eventDescription));

      $result .= '</div>';
      $result .= '</article>';
      echo $result;
    }
